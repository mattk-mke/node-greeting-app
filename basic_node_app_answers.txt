Exercises:

> What is a Node module?

A: A node module is a set of methods or other objects that can be reused outside of the module.

> What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

A: `exports` can be reassigned to another value without affecting the module's exported objects since it is only a reference. `module.export` is the primary exports object and if it is reassigned, the exports will not work.

> Why is using exports recommended?

A: It is more convenient to write the shorthand. Also, it is safer to work with its properties.
